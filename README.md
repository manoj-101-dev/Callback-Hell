## About

The JavaScript code in this repository illustrates a countdown from 10 to 1 using `setTimeout` functions. Each countdown number is logged to the console and displayed in an HTML element with the ID `demo` using a callback function `callback()`.

## Code Overview

The main `countdown` function uses nested `setTimeout` calls to initiate the countdown sequence. The `callback` function is responsible for updating the content inside the HTML element `demo` with the countdown number.
